#Couple Trivia

For Etown’s Valentines Day coding challenge, I created a web application game. This game is played by a couple sharing 1 computer, and it tests each person’s knowledge of the other person in the form of trivia. I built this application using node.js and React.

To play, you will need node.js installed on your computer. Then, you can download the source code, open the folder in terminal, then run `npm run start`
